## Recommended planning process

There three approaches:

1. Inaccurate estimations - when you need to know raw estimations, for instance if you need to prepare initial offer.
2. Accurate estimations - when you need more accurate estimations, for instance if you need to prepare final sale offer.
3. Planning - when you need to prepare the development plan

In all cases, the general flow is the same as presented in ["Planning step-by-step"](step_by_step.md),
but you should skip some steps or there is no need to make them well-detailed.

Setting up Jekyll project and sharing it is too much consuming so it is not recommended for the two first cases. Try to keep the general form so it can be easily incorporated into Jekyll project later, in case 3.


### Inaccurate planning

1. Collect significant requirements, preferences and project idea description.
2. Define Epics and user stories. You can limit to the most significant and descriptions doesn't have to be well-detailed.
3. Pick up initial techstack - limit to the significant technologies.
4. Note the general idea about architecture.
5. Define challenges and estimate the risk/unpredictability.


### Accurate planning

Some of them can be already done with the **Inaccurate planning**.

1. Collect significant requirements, preferences and project idea description.
2. Define Epics and user stories. You can limit to the most significant and descriptions doesn't have to be well-detailed.
3. Pick up initial techstack - limit to the significant technologies.
4. Note the general idea about architecture and infrastructure.
5. Create initial wireframes.
6. Define features from user stories, epics and requirements.
7. Define challenges and estimate the risk/unpredictability. Try to find reliable solution.
8. Create estimations and roadmap.
9. Collect all useful resources, materials that you used in planning (ie. links to blog posts that you used working on challenges etc.)


### Planning

During the planning, we work on designs and technical layer. It can be more reasonable to focus first on designs, so in this case, the phase II is more about working on designs (key views & components) and you should minimize the effort put on technical issues. In the phase II we work mostly on designs in the close cooperation with the client. Once the designs are accepted, we are moving to the phase III.

#### Phase I - prepare to the planning

1. Collect materials, requirements and project details from client
2. Go quickly through ["Planning step-by-step"](step_by_step.md) and check if there are missing materials.
3. [Optional]: Kick-off call with client when you can collect more details and missing materials.

#### Phase II - design

1. Follow 1-8 steps ["Planning step-by-step"](step_by_step.md). Focus on preparing all what would be needed to create wireframes.
2. Use wireframes to create designs (only key views, components).
3. Call with client to present the our plan & ideas to get his feedback.
4. Apply feedback.
5. Repeat 2-4. Each round is a one review. Once the designs are accepted, go to next phase.

#### Phase III - tech & design planning

1. Follow 1-8 steps ["Planning step-by-step"](step_by_step.md) like in the previous step, but this time, be more accurate, make well detailed documentation.
2. Meanwhile, add more designs.
3. Sum up planning, especially estimations.
4. [Optional]: call with the client to present the final results, estimations, roadmap, etc.

#### Phase IV - production set up

1. Step 9 from ["Planning step-by-step"](step_by_step.md): Create tasks from features and make kick-off call with the team.

And finally go to the production (development).
