## Add Estimations & roadmap

Create a roadmap and estimations. There is no recommended way to do that for now.
You can add it to the **Introduction**/**System** category or create a new category: `_docs/1300_estimations`.

The purpose of roadmap and estimations is to give a raw perspective
how much time it may take to build specific features, reach milestones and what is
the recommended order.
