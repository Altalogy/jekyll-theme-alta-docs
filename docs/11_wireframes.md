## Wireframes

You can store all content in a single document:

- `_docs/0600_system/0630_wireframes`
- `_docs/0700_architecture/0703_wireframes`
- `_docs/0800_designs/08xx_wireframes`

Or as a list of docs in a dedicated category:

- `_docs/0800_wireframes/08xx_my_wireframe_1.md`


You place images in the document(s) or the link to the project shared on Zeplin, Figma, etc.

```
